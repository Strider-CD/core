## Core Principals

### This project is API only

This means that any Pull Requests that add client side code will be rejected,
with a simple explanation and a link to this section. 

This project is meant to be the "core", so it will avoid any bloat, and only have the
essentials for managing projects/drones. For client side or cli interfaces, feel free to
contribute to existing projects: [client] and [cli]. Feel free to submit issues on the respective project
repositories.

If there are any other questions, feel free to submit an issue in this repository.

### Reuse existing modules

npm has many great modules, so make sure to have a look or ask in an issue or PR about any modules that
others may know about.
